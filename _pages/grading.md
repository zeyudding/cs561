Your final grade is based on the following:

* Group presentation (10%)
    * During the semester, students will join a group of 2 or 3 people to do a presentation for 35 minutes (30 min talk plus 5 min Q&A). You can choose any topic that is related to data privacy. You must prepare slides for your presentation. 
    * **Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oow2mXdtrfPnPNm5jo05Xm0QvKQKRzB7K8gKoQM_Bns/edit?usp=sharing) to reserve a presentation slot** (you can fill the paper title later). 
* Paper review (5 * 6% = 30%)
    * Each student is required to write five paper reviews for papers presented in the course. Submit your paper reviews on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.binghamton.edu/). Please read this guideline before you write a review.
* Two written assignments (20%)  and one programming assignment (10%).
* Final project (group of size 2, 3 or 4: 30%)
    * **Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cNNmNkaeo9mUUlXlblIyffx3kAAHcUHF-0qn8epRqbo/edit?usp=sharing) to register your team with a tentative title, and submit your final report on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.binghamton.edu/)**.
